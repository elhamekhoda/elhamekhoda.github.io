<br>

I am a Computational Data Science Researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (UCSD), where I manage computing resources for the National Research Platform (NRP) and support researchers in advancing their work. With a background in particle physics, I specialize in developing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for both offline and real-time data analysis, bridging the gap between cutting-edge computational techniques and impactful scientific discovery.

My current research focus includes:
- Efficient ML algorithms for scientific applications (Eg. HEP trigger, nouroscience)
- Uncertainty-aware ML algorithm 

If you want to collaborate please reach out to me.
